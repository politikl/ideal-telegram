This project is a Python-based typing automation tool that simulates natural human keystrokes for any given text input. Instead of instantly pasting or outputting the content, it types it out with realistic variations in speed, timing, and pauses, making the behavior appear more organic. The tool is designed to integrate smoothly with applications, editors, and extensions that expect natural typing patterns, ensuring the output feels authentic and not artificially generated. Itâ€™s lightweight, customizable, and ideal for scenarios where human-like typing flow is important.
